I was born and raised in Toledo, Ohio, and originally started my professional journey in law enforcement, working as a police officer. Over time, I developed a strong interest in data and how it can be used to make smarter decisions and uncover insights. That curiosity led me to make a big career change and go back to school to study Data Analytics.

I’m currently finishing up my bachelor’s degree in Data Analytics with a minor in Economics at the University of Toledo, where I’ve maintained a 3.6 GPA. Since Fall 2024, I’ve also served as the acting Treasurer of the UToledo Data Community. In that role, I’ve managed our organization’s budget, coordinated funding for events, and helped implement more efficient financial tracking systems. I’ve also worked on securing sponsorships and organizing workshops that bring industry knowledge to students.

Outside of class, I enjoy helping others who are new to the field. I’ve spent a lot of time tutoring students and introducing them to tools like SQL, Python, R, and Tableau. I remember what it was like starting out, so I try to make things approachable and practical, especially for those transitioning into data from other backgrounds like I did.

My background has given me a unique perspective combining real world experience, strong communication skills, and a love for problem solving and I’m excited to keep growing in the data space.
